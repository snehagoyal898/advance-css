 CSS variables are defined using the -- prefix followed by a variable name. 
They allow us to store and reuse values throughout our stylesheet, making it easier to maintain consistency and 
make global changes.
 CSS variables allow us to store values that we can reuse across our stylesheet. The var() 
function lets us reference these values wherever needed, reducing redundancy and making our code 
cleaner©
By using variables, we can ensure consistent values for colors, spacing, fonts, and more 
throughout our entire design. Changing a variable's value will automatically update all instances where the 
variable is used©
If we need to make a design change, we can update the variable's value once, and the 
change will be applied to all instances using that variable
